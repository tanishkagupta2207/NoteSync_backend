## üìñ Introduction

The NoteSync Backend is a RESTful API built to handle the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of notes. It serves as the backbone for the NoteSync application, ensuring that users' notes are always up-to-date and accessible from any device.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with ease.
- **Retrieve Notes**: Access your notes from anywhere.
- **Update Notes**: Modify existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes that are no longer needed.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Synchronization**: Real-time synchronization of notes across devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with the NoteSync Backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tanishkagupta2207/NoteSync_Backend.git
    cd NoteSync-Backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. **Update CorsOptions:**
    Update origin value in corsOptions in index.js file to your frontend base url
    ```
    const corsOptions = {
        origin: your_base_frontend_url,  // Only allow your frontend to access the backend
        methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],  // Allow GET and POST requests
        allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'auth-token'],  // Allow these headers in requests
    };
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_DB_URL=your_database_url
    REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

5. **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:5000`. Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.

## üì° API Endpoints

Here are some of the key API endpoints available:

- **POST /api/auth/createUser**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate a user and obtain a token.
- **POST /api/auth/getUser**: Retrieve a user Details.
- **POST /api/notes/addNote**: Create a new note.
- **GET /api/notes/fetchAllNotes**: Retrieve all notes.
- **PUT /api/notes/updateNote/:id**: Update a specific note by ID.
- **DELETE /api/notes/deleteNote/:id**: Delete a specific note by ID.
